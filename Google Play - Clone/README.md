## Description

Welcome to **googleplaystore**!
Google has redesigned Google Play's interface on several occasions. In February 2011, Google introduced a website interface for the then-named Android Market that provides access through a computer.[68] Applications purchased are downloaded and installed on an Android device remotely, with a "My Market Account" section letting users give their devices a nickname for easy recognition.[69] In May 2011, Google added new application lists to Android Market, including "Top Paid", "Top Free", "Editor's Choice", "Top Grossing", "Top Developers", and "Trending".[70][71] In July, Google introduced an interface with a focus on featured content, more search filters, and (in the US) book sales and movie rentals.[72] In May 2013, a redesign to the website interface matched the then-recently redesigned Android app.[73] In July 2014, the Google Play Store Android app added new headers to the Books/Movies sections, a new Additional Information screen offering a list featuring the latest available app version, installed size, and content rating, and simplified the app permissions prompt into overview categories.[74] A few days later, it got a redesign consistent with the then-new Material Design design language,[75][76] and the app was again updated in October 2015 to feature new animations, divide up the content into "Apps and Games" and "Entertainment" sections
